A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

 I have finished the Third Flutter Development Challenge  :
  
 I have chose that challenge to take a step in payment methods so,
 I have implemented a small cycle for payment method

 The first payment method ( Visa ): 
 I have used Stripe to make payments with visa ,
 I have integrated Stripe to flutter with Clean Architecture through a package - Flutter Stripe and Stripe Documentation.
 
the second payment method ( Paypal ) : 
 I have integrated  Paypal to flutter through a package called Flutter Paypal Payment and its easy to use.
 
 Account to test Paypal:
